1. My Database is currently located in CS302 Under Rayden_Project

So basically i was able to implement most of what i wanted i think i had like this crazy idea of pictures of all the items and everything and character customization but i think that was farfetched and out of my league as of right now mainly just because of gathering all the .png and correct images would of been crazy but i was still able to implement character customization and make it as close as possible to how it is in game and then also you can customize your equipment and your quest you have completed and are completing. and my favorite part is definitely the main page where it shows all characters that have been created and you can click on any of them.

The character creation page is pretty cool. it walks you through selecting a class, race, faction, and character name. Database queries that enforce game rules are directly linked to each step. like the race table is filtered by faction_id when a faction is selected, and the race_class relationship table is used to query the available classes when a race is selected to guarantee that only legitimate race/class combinations show up. i think its cool because, instead of depending on hard coded rules, the page adjusts based on previous database results and employs constrained queries to enforce integrity while using the website.

The character equipment editor is another cool page i made with database interaction.you can equip items into designated gear slots on this page. To ensure that only legitimate items show up, the page's dropdowns are filled by querying the gear table and filtering by both slot and the character's class. to be able to sync the character's loadout with the database, the user submits changes that remove and replace existing rows in the character_equipment table with the new choices. This page is cool because it maintains the class and slot constraints specified in the database schema while fusing several conditional SELECT queries with transactional DELETE and INSERT operations.

How to work my git folder In Wow_webapp is everything the server.py file and all .html files and how my websit was formatted what go cmd in wow_webapp folder do venv\scripts\activate then python server.py and it would launch and wow_webapp was its own folder i then created a GitHub repository for easiness and submission and now i provided RaydenProject.sql which is a backup of my database ignore WowProject that is just the GitHub Repository.
